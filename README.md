# Swap Run
Swap run (working name) is an HTML5 game that is in the early stages of development.

The eventual goal is to create a fun, casual game accessible accross all platforms.

**[Play it here!](http://noahsug.github.io/swap-run/)**

**Move:** WASD or arrow keys or swipe

**Swap with the nearest enemy:** space or tap

## To come

Swap Run is still in the early stages of development. Future features include:
* Multiple levels of increasing difficulty to beat.
* Bosses and enemies with special powers (maybe an enemy that can swap with you!).
* Powerups that occasionally drop from killed enemies.
* RPG elements / unlockables to add replayability.
